ONWaRD is short for Online Network for Writing and Retrieving Data. This is a REST API service built with the Spring Boot framework that allows a platform where companies can electronically manage all their data, enabling them to go paperless. <br/>
This application demonstrates how to utilize Microsoft .NET Maui Framework, Spring Boot application, and Project Lombok to work together  to create an innovative product. <br/>
 <br/> This is a front end part <br/>

## _Architecture_

Frontend
* Microsoft .NET MAUI Framework: Our choice for the frontend to create a responsive and interactive user interface that operates across different platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android) with a single codebase.
* C# and XAML: The primary languages used for development, where C# provides the logic and XAML defines the UI layout and design. This combination ensures a powerful yet flexible way to build our appâ€™s interface.

Development Environment
* Visual Studio : The main Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for the project, Mianly devleopd for hightly focus gcc..NET Extension Pack, and more for comprehensive development support.

Integration and Data Management
* JSON: Standard format for data exchange between the frontend and backend, ensuring compatibility and ease of data manipulation.
